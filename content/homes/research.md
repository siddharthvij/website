#### Risk Management with Variable Capital Utilization and Procyclical Collateral Capacity (with [Guojun Chen](https://bizfaculty.nus.edu.sg/faculty-details/?profId=693), and [Zhongjin Lu](https://sites.google.com/view/genelu/home) ) <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3719158" target="_blank">[Paper]</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote> We build a risk management model that incorporates variable capital utilization and procyclical collateral capacity. The former means that capital utilization determines production, which affects capital depreciation and risk exposure, linking capital utilization to firms' risk management decisions. The latter means that the ability to borrow and hedge increases with expected profitability. Using a new dataset on hedging and capital utilization of oil and gas producers, we employ novel identification strategies and find that hedging is positively correlated with corporate liquidity and expected profitability, whereas utilization is negatively correlated with liquidity. These results support the key predictions of our theory.  </blockquote>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote> Bankruptcy reforms that improve lenders’ ability to recover claims from financially distressed borrowers can mitigate zombie lending. However, we show that a 2016 bankruptcy reform in India had only a limited impact since lenders remained reluctant to recognize zombie credit as non-performing. A subsequent complementary regulation targeting lender discretion in recognizing non-performing loans improves zombie recognition nearly five-fold. The mechanisms impeding bankruptcy reform efficacy include undercapitalized banks’ incentives to avoid provisioning for loan losses and political interference at state-owned banks. We also highlight a key reallocation channel: resolving zombie credit allows lenders to redirect credit to healthy borrowers, increasing investment.</blockquote>

##### Regulatory Risk Perception and Small Business Lending (with [Joseph Kalmenovitz](https://sites.google.com/view/jkalmenovitz/home)) <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3904357" target="_blank">[Paper]</a>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote> We uncover a significant friction in small business lending: perception of risk by Small Business Administration employees. Using novel data on SBA employees transferring across offices, we find that defaults on SBA loans in their previous location reduce SBA loans and job creation in their current location. The effect is independent of local economic conditions and the informational content of the non-local defaults, suggesting that SBA employees update their risk assessment irrationally. Our results are the first to document that regulators' potential misperception of economic conditions affects the ability of small businesses to obtain access to finance. </blockquote>

##### Foreign Currency Borrowing of Corporations as Carry Trades: Evidence from India (with [Viral V. Acharya](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~sternfin/vacharya/)) <a href="/pdf/ECBCarryTrade_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">[Paper]</a>  

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote> We establish that macroprudential policies limiting capital flows can curb risks arising from corporate foreign currency borrowing in emerging markets. Using detailed firm-level data from India, we show that propensity to issue foreign currency debt for the \emph{same} firm is higher when the difference in short-term interest rates between India and the US is higher, i.e., when the dollar `carry trade' is more profitable; this behavior is driven by the period after the global financial crisis. The positive relationship between issuance and the `carry trade' breaks down once regulators institute more stringent interest-rate caps on foreign currency borrowing. Riskier borrowers such as importers and those with higher interest costs cut issuance most. Firm equity exposure to foreign exchange risk rose after issuance in favorable funding conditions and emerged as a source of external sector vulnerability during the `taper tantrum’ of 2013. Macroprudential policy action limiting capital flows is able to nullify this effect, such as during the market stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  </blockquote>

##### Acquiring Failed Banks <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3234435" target="_blank">[Paper]</a>  

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote> I study the relative importance of lending and deposit-taking for bank value in failed bank acquisitions. Comparing outcomes for winning banks to runner-up bidders in failed bank auctions, I find winners experience a 2.3\% abnormal return and this increase is mainly due to deposits, not loans.  After acquisition, the winning bank cuts lending to the failed bank's borrowers and closes branches but it retains almost all acquired deposits. These deposits are not channeled into lending elsewhere. Rather, the acquirer lowers deposit rates, reflecting increased market power. Declines in lending due to the acquisition have negative local economic effects.  </blockquote>

##### Lending to Influence Politicians: County-Level Evidence <a href="/pdf/PoliticalLending_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">[Paper]</a>  
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <blockquote> Using changes in the composition of the US House Financial Services Committee as a shock to a region's political importance, I provide evidence that financial institutions alter lending patterns depending on whether a county is represented by a member of the committee. The effects are asymmetric -- on gaining a member, counties see no immediate change but on losing a member, there is a decline in home mortgage loans originated. This asymmetry is consistent with models that emphasize reputation building in the market for political favors. Effects are greater where the politician receives less direct contributions suggesting that these indirect contributions might be substitutes for direct giving.  In the presence of limits on campaign contributions, these results emphasize alternate channels that firms may employ to influence politicians. </blockquote>
